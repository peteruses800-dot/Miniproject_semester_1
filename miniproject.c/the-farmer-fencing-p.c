// 🧮 Problem Title: The Farmer’s Fencing Problem
// 💡 Problem Story:
// A farmer named Raju owns a rectangular piece of land.
// He wants to build a fence around it and also plant crops inside the land.

// To plan the fencing and crop area, he needs to calculate:

// The area of the rectangle (for crops).

// The perimeter of the rectangle (for fencing).

// He knows the length and width of the land in meters.
// Can you help Raju write a program to find both the area and perimeter of his land?

// 🧠 Task:
// Write a program that takes two integers as input — the length and width of the rectangle —
// and prints the area and perimeter.

// 📥 Input Format:
// The first line contains two integers,
// length and width — dimensions of the rectangle.

// 📤 Output Format:
// Print two lines:

// First line: "Area = <value>"

// Second line: "Perimeter = <value>"
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int l , w , area, perimeter;
    printf("enter the value of length");
    scanf("%d",&l);
    printf("enter the value of width");
    scanf("%d",&w);

    area = l*w;
    perimeter = 2*(l+w);

    printf("Area=<%d>",area);
    printf("Perimeter = <%d>",perimeter);
    return 0;
